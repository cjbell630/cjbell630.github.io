    <!-- ROLES -->
    <h4 data-text="ROLE-SELECTION"></h4>
    <p>In the server's "roles" channel, there are 3 messages sent back in August of 2021 which have been edited
        overtime (because sending a new message would notify members unnecessarily). These messages allow members to
        choose roles, which are groups members can be placed which can do things like give special access to certain
        channels, or notify only members of a certain group.</p>
    <div class="row">
        <img src="../../../public/juga-bot-roles.png" width="500vw" alt="Screenshot of JUGA bot role selection">
        <div style="display: block">
            <p style="padding-left: 0.5em;">In JUGA's case, since it's an academic-based server,
                there are roles representing current Japanese professors, which can be chosen using the buttons in the
                first message. When a user presses one of the blue buttons, they are given the role corresponding to
                that professor. Alternatively, if they press one of the green or red buttons, they are given a role
                corresponding to that situation. Additionally, when any of these buttons are pressed, any roles the
                member previously had are removed, meaning a member may have only one of these roles at a time. </p>
            <p style="padding-left: 0.5em;">The next two messages use dropdown menus with checkboxes, and allow the user
                to select their preferred pronouns (visible to other users), as well as additional roles, such as the
                Computer Science role, which gives them access to that channel. Unlike the professor roles, users may
                have any combination of these roles.</p>
        </div>

    <p>The contents of this message are determined via a JSON file, which is read and used to update the messages at
        startup. When the messages are interacted with, the Discord API gives the bot nothing but the nature of the
        interaction (the member who interacted, as well as the chosen options if it's a dropdown) and a single
        customizable ID string, so I created an ID system which allows the bot to quickly determine which type of button
        is being pressed and deliver the event to the correct handler.</p>

    <!-- POLLS -->
    <h4 data-text="POLL-CREATION"></h4>
    <p>After creating the bot, I realized we would benefit from the ability to create polls, in which users could ask
        questions to users and see their responses visualized in various ways. Of course, there were already bots that
        could perform this function, but they all used old workarouds to allow the users to respond, rather than
        using newer interaction features, which allowed for bots to add things like buttons to their messages.</p>
